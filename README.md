# Blog-App---MERN-Stack-Project
The Blog App is a MERN stack project where users can create and view blog posts. It features a React frontend with a form to submit blogs, which are stored in MongoDB via a Node.js + Express backend. Blogs are fetched and displayed in real-time with a clean, responsive UI and slug-based identifiers.
